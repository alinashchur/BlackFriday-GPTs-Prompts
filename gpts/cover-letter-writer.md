A prompt that helps you write tailored cover letters for every position. 



Pro-tip:

1) Run through the output yourself to validate there are no errors grammatically or truthfully in your draft.

2) After running the initial prompt, if the letter runs a bit long ask ChatGPT to rewrite it more concisely. I've had some of these concise drafts need zero tweaking.

# Prompt

```
Prompt 1: I want you to act as CoverLetterGPT, a seasoned expert cover letter writer with decades of experience tailoring cover letters for executive-level positions. You write in a convincing and professional tone that engages the reader based on the context I will give you. Let's work together to build the ideal prompt for my goals based on a series of steps:

1: My initial prompt [I will give you an initial prompt]
2: Your request for more details: [You will request 7-10 specific details about my original prompt in order to fully understand what I want from you. These should lean heavily on the context I provide you in my original prompt. Output these questions in an easy to answer list format]
3: My Answers [I will then answer these questions - providing you with the key details that you need]
4: You will then act as a professional prompt engineer and create a more detailed prompt for ChatGPT, combining my original prompt, along with the additional details provided in Step 3. Output this new prompt for ChatGPT, and ask me if I'm happy with it.
5: If I say yes, continue to then generate a response to this upgrade prompt.
6: If I say no, ask me which details about this prompt I am not happy with.
7: I will then provide you with this extra information.
8: Generate another prompt, similar to step 4, but taking into account the alterations I asked for in step 7.

Repeat steps 6 - 8 until I am happy with the prompt that you generate. If you understand all these instructions, please reply back with "It's cover letter time!"

Prompt 2: Please write me a cover letter draft. This cover letter should include a standout opening, relevant skills and qualifications, and a strong finish with a call-to-action, all fitting on one standard 8.5 x 11 page. Here is the job description: #[jobdescription]

About Travers Smith
It is not just law at Travers Smith. We treat our clients’ business as our business, their dispute as our dispute, their challenge as ours.

We act for publicly listed and private companies, private equity and financial sponsors, and other business enterprises involved in large and complex UK and cross-border matters, transactions and disputes.

Our clients know that, wherever in the world their ambitions lie, we will work as part of their team to get things done. And they know that we will do so in a straight-talking and open way.

Diversity and independence of thought are key to our success. We know each other well and we know that we get the best results when we act as a team – not just within our individual departments, but right across our firm where we welcome views from everyone.

What we do
Our business spans four key areas across advisory, contentious, regulatory and transactional focuses, comprising of the following main practice areas: Competition, Corporate M&A and ECM, Dispute Resolution, Derivatives & Structures Products, Employment, Finance, Financial Services & Markets, Funds, Incentives & Remuneration, Operational Risk & Environment, Pensions, Private Equity & Financial Sponsors, Real Estate, Regulatory Investigations and Tax, and Technology & Commercial Transactions.

What we look for
We’ll give you responsibility from day one – you will quickly find yourself on the phone to clients, in meetings and handling your own work with all the guidance you need. As such, the firm looks for people who can combine academic excellence with plain common sense; who are determined, articulate and able to think on their feet; who are self-motivated and have a healthy sense of humour.

A law degree is not a necessity – over 40% of our trainees have non-law backgrounds.

Training Programme
The firm’s comprehensive training programme ensures that trainees experience a broad range of work. All trainees sit with partners and associates, which ensures a refreshing lack of hierarchy and unparalleled opportunities to learn by osmosis from some of the most senior people at the firm. It also means that trainees receive individual and extensive training from experienced lawyers and can look forward to client contact, and the responsibility that goes with it, from day one.

During the two-year training contract, you will rotate through four different legal departments. Trainees spend six months in one of our corporate departments, with the rest of their training contract spread across the other departments. A large proportion of our trainees also spend one of these rotations in our Dispute Resolution or Employment teams. For the other two rotations trainees are asked to indicate a department of interest, which includes the opportunity to spend six months in the firm’s Paris office.

Travers Smith is a collaborative firm – we treat each other with respect and encourage our people to be themselves. We are very proud of the close-knit, supportive and non-hierarchical culture this creates.
